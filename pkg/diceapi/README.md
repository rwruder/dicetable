The goal of this project is to create a REST API to read and write from a database storing info on dice tables, pools, and users, as well as keeping logs of each roll made.

diceMOD - stores the database models
diceSQL - fuctions that interact with the SQL database
diceAPI - connects to client and sends data as JSON
